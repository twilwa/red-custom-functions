# This function, fetch_and_insert_messages, takes a query, channel_name, and an optional num_messages parameter to determine how many messages to fetch and insert into the conversation context. It then fetches messages from the specified channel, assuming the latest messages are the most relevant, and inserts them into the conversation context as 'user' role messages. This is a simplified approach for demonstration purposes; in a real implementation, you might want to distinguish between user and bot messages or filter messages based on the query more intelligently.

#Please note that this is a conceptual example. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the specific details of your application, such as how the conversation object is accessed and updated within your framework.
